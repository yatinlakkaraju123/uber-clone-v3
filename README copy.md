Cabs on Go

About  

The web application Cabs on Go is built to solve the problem of middlemen in cab service apps by using blockchain technology by creating a decentralized application which allows the customer to directly book a cab without having the need of a middleman which results in increased profitability for the driver as well as the customer.
 
The app uses the Ethereum blockchain to manage transactions between users. Th!
is is done using smart contracts written in Solidity, which would be deployed on the blockchain. 

The smart contracts would manage the transfer of funds between users and ensure that the cab booking transactions are executed correctly.

Insight

•	It is a D-app on Ethereum.

•	Smart contract is there in Backend.

•	Front-end is made with React.Js

•	We are using Metamask Browser Extension to connect to the Ethereum Network.

•	We use Ganache as the Ethereum network for testing purposes.

•	In the app we can register as a Driver or Customer.

•	The flow for a Driver is:

 1) They can see the ride a customer has requested from pickup point to drop point.
 2) After the Driver accepts the ride he reaches the pick up point.
 3) At the end of the ride the driver receives the payment from the customer.

•	The flow for the Customer is:
 1)	The customer enters the From and To location on the app.
 2)	After entering this information if a driver accepts the ride the customer is shown the details about the same.
 3)	Once the ride finishes the customer pays the driver directly.
